# this file defines a set of jobs that will run when triggered on a cloned version of your repo
# a job is a set of steps
# by default, theres just one job and you give it its list of steps

# by default, all branches get built
# but adding a trigger configuration like this says "only build master branch"
trigger:
- master

# a pool is a set of machines for running this job
# this configuration says: "use Microsoft's hosted Ubuntu Linux virtual machines"
# (we could, if we wanted, have it connect to a machine WE control to run the job on)
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

# the steps in the job
# "script" is one kind of step - on linux itll run in bash
# give all steps a good display name
